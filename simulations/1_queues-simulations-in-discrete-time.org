* Simulation in Discrete time

** one  period,  demand, service capacity, and queue

There is one server, jobs enter a queue in front of the server, and the server serves batches of customers, every hour say.
#+begin_src python
L = 10
a = 5
d = 8
L = L + a -d
print(L)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 7

#+begin_src python
L = 3
a = 5
c = 7
d = min(c, L)
L += a -d
print(d, L)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| 3 | 5 |

** two periods

#+begin_src python
L = 3
a = 5
c = 7
d = min(c, L)
L += a - d

a = 6
d = min(c, L)
L += a - d
print(d, L)

a = 9*np.ones(num)
c = 10*np.ones(num)
L = np.zeros_like(a)

L[0] = 20
for i in range(1, num):
    d = min(c[i], L[i-1])
    L[i] = L[i-1] + a[i] - d

print(L)
#+end_src

** Compute mean and std of simulated queue length for \rho \approx 1

We discuss the concept of load more formally in the course at a later point in time.
Conceptually the load is the rate at which work arrives. For instance, if $\lambda=5$ jobs arrive per hour, and each requires 20 minutes of work (on average), then we say that the load is $5\times 20/60 = 5/3$. Since one server can do only 1 hour of work per hour, we need at least two servers to deal with this load. We define the utilization $\rho$ as the load divided by the number of servers present.

In discrete time, we define $\rho$ as the average number of jobs arriving per period divided by the average number of jobs we can serve per period. Slightly more formally, for discrete time,
\begin{align}
\rho \approx \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{c_{k}}}.
\end{align}
And formally, we should take the limit $n\to\infty$ (but such limits are  a bit hard to obtain in simulation).

#+begin_src python
num = 5_000

np.random.seed(3)
a = np.random.uniform(5, 8, size=num)
c = (5+8)/1.99 * np.ones(num)
L = np.zeros_like(a)  # queue length at the end of a period

L[0] = 20
for i in range(1, num):
    d = min(c[i], L[i-1])
    L[i] = L[i-1] + a[i] - d

print(L.mean(), L.std())

\begin{exercise}
Change the code such that the arrivals that occur in period $i$ can also be served in period $i$.
Explain how this works, make a graph and compare your results with the results of the  simulation we do here (i.e.
arrivals cannot be served in the periods in which they arrive).
\end{exercise}

** Start with a large queue, take \rho< 1, show the drift

#+begin_src python :results value file
num = 5_000

np.random.seed(3)
a = np.random.uniform(5, 8, size=num)
c = (5+8)/1.8 * np.ones(num)
L = np.zeros_like(a)  # queue length at the end of a period

L[0] = 2_000

Things to memorize:
- if the capacity is equal or less than the arrival rate, the queue lenght will explode.
- If the capacity is larger than the arrival rate, the queue length will stay around 0 (between quotes).
- If we start with a huge queue, but the service capacity is larger than the  arrival rate, then the queue will drain rather fast, in fact, about linear.

\begin{exercise}
When $\rho < 1$ and $L_0$ is some large number, such as here.
Why is the normal distribution reasonable to model the  time $\tau$ until the queue hits zero for the first time?
Use simulation to estimate  the expected time $\E \tau$ and variance $\V \tau$.
(You can also try to use EVE's law here, if you're fanatic; but if you're not, just skip the analytic part.)

Repeat the above simulation a number of times with different seeds (why?)
to estimate $\E \tau$ and $\V \tau$.
\end{exercise}

Spoiler alert, hint: When $L_{0} \gg 1$, then  $a_{k}$ jobs arrive in period $k$ and $c_{k}$ jobs leave.
For ease, write $h_{k} = c_k-a_k$.
Then the time $\tau$ to hit 0, i.e., the time until the queue is empty, is such that $\sum_{k=1}^{\tau} h_{k} \geq L_{0}$.
But then, $\E \tau \E{h_{k}} = L_{0}$.
Moreover, consider any sum of random variables, then with  $\mu = \E X$, $\sigma$  the std of $X$, and $N$ the normal distribution, and by the central limit theorem,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} \sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}) \implies \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \sim N(n \mu, n\sigma^{2}).
\end{equation}

Bigger hint.
Below is the code that I use.
Let me explain how it works.
I want to find the smallest $\tau$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{\tau} (a_{k}-c_{k}) \geq L_{0}$.
Since I know that $L_{0} \gg 0$, I don't have to compute $d_{k}=\min\{L_{k-1}, c_{k}\}$, because $L_{k-1} > c_{k}$ as long as there jobs in the system.
So, I can skip the computation of $d_{k}$; it saves also computer time.
Then, I just guess that 5000 periods is enough to always clear the queue.
However, this is nothing but a guess.
Here I don't check this, but formally speaking I should do so.
(It is not a problem to live in a state of sin; as long as you know you are sinning, it's ok :-) ).
Then I change the seed to get different runs; here I do ~N=10~ runs.
Finally, I assemble the hitting times for the different runs in the vector ~tau~.
And, ~numpy~ offers the functions ~mean~ and ~std~ that I can call on vectors, so I don't have to compute that myself.

#+begin_src python
import numpy as np

num = 5_000


def hitting_time(seed):
    np.random.seed(seed)
    a = np.random.uniform(5, 8, size=num)
    c = (5 + 8) / 1.8 * np.ones(num)

    L = 2_000
    for i in range(1, num):
        L += +a[i] - c[i]
        if L <= 0:
            return i


N = 10
tau = np.zeros(N)
for n in range(N):
    tau[n] = hitting_time(n)

print(tau.mean(), tau.std())
#+end_src


** Queues with blocking.
We have a queue subject to blocking.
When the queue exceeds $K$, say, then whatever of the  batch of items coming  in exceeds $K$ is rejected.
This is the so-called complete reject rule. Two more assumptions: service occurs before arrival, and jobs  arriving in a period cannot be served.

#+begin_src python
num = 500

np.random.seed(3)
a = np.random.randint(0, 20, size=num)
c = 10*np.ones(num)
L = np.zeros_like(a)  # queue length at the end of a period
loss = np.zeros_like(a)  # queue length at the end of a period

K = 30 # max people in queue, otherwise they leave

L[0] = 28
for i in range(1, num):
    d = min(c[i], L[i-1])
    loss[i] = max(L[i-1] + a[i] - d - K, 0) # service before arrivals.
    L[i] = L[i-1] + a[i] - d - loss[i]

lost_fraction = sum(loss)/sum(a)
print(lost_fraction)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_src python :results value file

plt.plot(L)
plt.savefig('queue-discrete_loss.png')

#+end_src


If we would assume that departures occur at the end of a period (hence, after the arrivals), then the code has to be as follows:

#+begin_src python  :exports code
for i in range(1, num):
    d = min(c[i], L[i-1])
    loss[i] = max(L[i-1] + a[i] - K, 0) # service at end of period
    L[i] = L[i-1] + a[i] - d - loss[i]

lost_fraction = sum(loss)/sum(a)
print(lost_fraction)
#+end_src
