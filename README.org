#+TITLE: Queueing Theory and Simulation


* Contents of the files and directories:
- ~course_overview.org~:  Organization of the course Queueing Theory and Simulation.
- ~queueing-book.pdf~: the main text and exercises with hints and solutions.
- ~assignments.pdf~: material related to simulations, assignments, links to the youtube movies, and pdf files.
- ~assignment-answer-template.tex~: use this as the template for your assignments.
- ~slides~: rudimentary lecture slides
- ~book-sources/~: latex source files for the queueing book. There are many useful LaTeX things that you can learn from the LaTeX sources and the =preamble.sty=.

* Typos and changes

Here is a list of things I changed in the files during the course. (I don't mention very simple typos, like spelling errors).
- <2022-02-13 zo>: section 3.2: recursion for $L_k$ repaired, rewrite of some text (but no extra material).
- <2022-02-13 zo>: assignment 1: formula for $\rho$ repaired.
- <2022-02-13 zo>:  merged all assignments into one master document with the name =assignments.pdf=.
- <2022-02-14 ma> preliminaries: added some explanation why I (and many probability books) write $\d F(x)$ instead of $f(x) \d x$. I changed the notation from $F(\d x)$ to $\d F(x)$, because that is perhaps clearer, but notationally it means the same thing.
- <2022-02-14 ma>: Reformulation of ex 2.1.4  to prevent a potential misreading.
- <2022-02-14 ma>: reformulation of ex 2.1.8 to ensure that level 0 can be really hit. To improve your understanding, I inserted a new problem 2.1.9.
- <2022-02-15 di>: assignment dates repaired. See the course outline.
- <2022-02-17 do>: assignment 1: I simplified the questions about the hitting times, and ask to include a graph.
- <2022-02-23 wo> assignment 2 (psychiatrists): added a line to =computeQExtra=.
- <2022-02-24 do>: section 4.3 of the queueing book: I simplified the derivations a bit, but nothing serious. The old reasonings were just as good, but perhaps a bit too short.
- <2022-03-01 di>: Section 4.4 of queueing book: I added a derivation with Eve's law. If you are not interested, just skip it. However, the derivation is quite a bit faster (but a bit more advanced on conditional expectation).
